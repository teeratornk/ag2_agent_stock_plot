The v6 revision is heading in the right direction, but several gaps remain before it can be considered production-ready.

1. Data accuracy / YTD logic
   • The code section that actually converts raw prices to YTD % return is not visible. If you simply plot raw “Adj Close”, the figure is NOT a YTD-gain chart.  
   • Add:  
     ```
     ytd = price_df.div(price_df.iloc[0]).sub(1.0) * 100   # % gain
     ```
     …and plot `ytd` instead of raw prices.

2. Peak annotation bug still unresolved
   • You still slice `price_df["Close"]` (or `Adj Close`) as if it were a Series, but for multi-ticker downloads it is a DataFrame. Loop over symbols:  
     ```
     for sym in symbols:
         peaks = price_df[sym].nlargest(N_PEAKS)
         ...
     ```

3. Volume subplot
   • `vol_df` assignment is truncated in the snippet; be sure it is completed (`vol_df = data["Volume"].copy()`).  
   • Create a secondary subplot (`gridspec` or `fig.add_subplot(2,1,2, sharex=ax1)`) and use a bar chart with subdued color (e.g., gray with alpha).

4. Visual clarity / professional appearance
   • Choose distinct, color-blind-friendly lines (`colorblind` palette or matplotlib tab10).  
   • Increase line width for price, thinner for moving averages.  
   • Rotate and format x-axis ticks (`ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(mdates.DateFormatter('%b'))`).  
   • Add `ylabel` for “% Gain YTD” and “Volume (shares)”, a chart title with current date, and a concise legend.

5. Error handling
   • Wrap the `yf.download` call in try/except to catch connectivity issues.  
   • Verify the data frame is non-empty; exit gracefully if download fails.

6. Miscellaneous
   • Apply `plt.tight_layout()` before saving to avoid label clipping.  
   • Save file name should embed the year or date for traceability (e.g., `f"ytd_stock_gains_{current_year}.png"`).

Address the above and the chart should meet production quality standards.
