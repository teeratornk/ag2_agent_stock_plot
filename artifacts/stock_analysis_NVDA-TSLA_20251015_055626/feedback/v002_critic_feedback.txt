The script is headed in the right direction, but several points still need attention before it can be considered production-ready.

1. Data accuracy  
   • The excerpt does not actually show the YTD-normalisation logic. Make sure you:  
     – Pull Adjusted Close, not Close.  
     – Slice from the first trading day of the current year (`pd.Timestamp.today().year`).  
     – Normalise to 100 or calculate % change from that first price.  
   • Confirm that the moving-average windows (20 & 50) are computed on the already-normalised series, otherwise the MA lines will be on a different scale.

2. Plot features  
   • Moving averages and annotations are listed as active, but the code shown does not build or plot them. Ensure they are added with distinguishable colours/linestyles and that the legend reflects them.  
   • Annotation helpers (e.g., last price, YTD % gain) would greatly improve interpretability—verify they exist in the hidden portion.

3. Visual clarity & professional appearance  
   • The duplicate style-selection block is redundant. Keep one try/except.  
   • Explicitly set `figsize`, line widths, and font sizes in the call to `plt.subplots()` for consistency.  
   • Add:  
     – Title: “YTD Performance 2024 – NVDA vs TSLA”  
     – X-label “Date”, Y-label “Indexed price (Jan 1 = 100)”  
     – Tight layout (`fig.tight_layout()`) before saving.  

4. Error handling  
   • The broad `except Exception: pass` swallows important failures (e.g., style not found, file-write permissions). Replace with specific exceptions or at least log a warning via `print()` or `logging`.  
   • Wrap the data download block in try/except to handle network or symbol errors gracefully.

5. Code hygiene  
   • Remove unused imports (`sys as _sys`).  
   • Use more descriptive variable names instead of leading underscores outside the “private helper” context.  
   • Save the file with `dpi=150` or similar to improve resolution.

Addressing the above will satisfy all evaluation criteria.
