The v7 script is moving in the right direction, but several critical issues remain before it can be considered production-ready.

1. Data accuracy – YTD calculation still missing  
   • The snippet shows only raw price downloads. There is no explicit conversion to YTD % gain (price / first-price – 1).  
   • Fix:  
     ```
     adj = df['Adj Close']
     ytd = adj.div(adj.iloc[0]).sub(1).mul(100)   # % gain
     ```
   • Ensure the first row is the first trading day of the current year, not merely the first row returned.

2. Volume subplot  
   • The code imports volume but the implementation is truncated. Confirm that:  
     – A separate axis (`ax2 = ax1.twinx()` or `fig.add_subplot`) is created.  
     – Volume is plotted as bars with alpha≈0.3 so it doesn’t hide price lines.  
     – Axis label “Volume (shares)” is added and a secondary y-axis is visually distinct (e.g., grey tick labels).

3. Moving averages / peaks / annotations  
   • No visible code that actually computes SMA (e.g., 20-day, 50-day) or finds peaks (`scipy.signal.find_peaks` or `argrelextrema`).  
   • Implement them and add a legend entry. Use markers or small arrows for peak annotations to avoid clutter.

4. Visual clarity  
   • Choose a consistent color palette; currently style fallback can yield conflicting defaults. Manually assign colors per symbol and MA lines.  
   • Use thicker lines for prices (lw≈2) and thinner, semi-transparent lines for MAs.  
   • Rotate x-tick labels and format dates with `mdates.DateFormatter('%Y-%m')`.

5. Labels / title  
   • Add a concise title such as “YTD % Return – NVDA vs TSLA (2024)”.  
   • y-axis should read “% Return (YTD)”, not “Price”.  
   • Include `fig.tight_layout()` before saving.

6. Error handling  
   • Wrap yfinance download in try/except and raise a clear message if symbols are invalid or internet is down.  
   • Handle missing data with `dropna(how='all')` after aligning tickers.

7. File save confirmation  
   • Print the save location and ensure `dpi=300` for publication-quality output.

Addressing the above will satisfy the data-accuracy requirement and elevate overall professionalism.
