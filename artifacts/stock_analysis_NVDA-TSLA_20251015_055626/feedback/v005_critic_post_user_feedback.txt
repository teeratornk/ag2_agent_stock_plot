1. Alignment with prior guidance:  
Yes. Adding a dedicated volume subplot, clearer annotations, refined color palette, and more explicit labels directly address the most recent critic notes on informational depth, visual clarity, and professional polish.

2. Missing high-impact enhancements:  
• Robust error handling for missing/invalid data is still not visible.  
• Consider adding a candlestick view or shading for gain/loss days to improve visual insight.  
• Interactive hover tooltips (e.g., via mplcursors) would further aid exploration but are optional.

3. Next concrete step: Implement basic data-validation/error-handling wrappers around the data-loading and YTD-calculation functions to avoid silent failures and provide user-friendly warnings.
