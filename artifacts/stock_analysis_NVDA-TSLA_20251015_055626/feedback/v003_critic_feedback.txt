The script is progressing, but several key items still need refinement before it can be considered production-ready.

1. Data accuracy (YTD logic)
   • The snippet ends before the YTD normalisation step.  
     – Make sure you take the price on the first trading day of the year for each symbol and transform the full series to a percentage or index (e.g., `price / price.iloc[0] - 1` or `price / price.iloc[0] * 100`).  
     – Confirm you are using Adjusted Close throughout (you handled the MultiIndex case correctly, but the single‐index branch is truncated).  
     – Guard against a holiday/weekend at the beginning of the year by calling `.first_valid_index()`.

2. Plot features
   • Moving averages: you declare `[20, 50]` but the plotting code is not shown. Be sure to:  
     – Compute MA on the *normalised* series (or plot on price lines with a secondary axis).  
     – Use a lighter colour/α so the MA lines don’t overpower the main series.  
   • Peak / annotate features: not visible in the snippet. Verify that:  
     – Peak detection is done on the YTD series, not raw price.  
     – The annotation text is clipped to stay in the figure bounds.  
   • Grid: add `plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3, linestyle='--')` for readability.

3. Visual clarity
   • Choose a consistent matplotlib style (e.g., `plt.style.use("seaborn-v0_8")`).  
   • Explicitly set `figsize` and `dpi` for retina clarity: `plt.figure(figsize=(12,6), dpi=110)`.  
   • Label axes:  
     – y-axis: “YTD Return (%)” or “Indexed Price (Jan-1 = 100)”.  
     – x-axis: “Date”.  
   • Provide a descriptive title such as “NVDA vs TSLA – YTD Performance”.

4. Error handling
   • Wrap the `yf.download` call in try/except to catch network/HTTP errors.  
   • Check for empty DataFrames and stop gracefully with an informative message.  
   • When computing moving averages, handle shorter data series (use `min_periods=1`).

5. Professional appearance
   • Ensure legends do not overlap annotations by using `loc="best"` or manual placement.  
   • Tight layout (`plt.tight_layout()`) before saving to file.  
   • Save the plot with a transparent background or a white facecolor for presentations (`plt.savefig(output_file, facecolor='white')`).

Once these items—particularly the correct YTD normalisation and visible implementation of the advertised features—are in place, the script will satisfy the stated criteria.
